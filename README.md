# Asynchronous-FIFO-Design
The objective of the project is to design a 32 x 16 Aysnchronous FIFO.
FIFO's are used as a solution of Clock Domain Crossing(CDC) for data transfer between two different clock domains.
Here, a Asynchronous FIFO is designed in verilog and implementation and simulation is done in Quartus Prime Lite.
